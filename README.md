# College Basketball Sim
# Overview
College Basketball Sim is an android game made in the classic mold of "manager style sim games". The user chooses a team that they would like to coach and from that point on they will be responsible for making strategic decisions as they sim through their schedule. At the end of each season, they will be able to recruit new players to replace the ones that will either be graduating or going pro. This game is still very much a work in progresss and I will be updating this readme file as I go along.
